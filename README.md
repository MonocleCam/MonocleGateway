# Monocle Gateway

The Monocle Gateway Service is a small service that you install and run
inside your network to order to facilitate communication between the
Monocle (cloud) platform and your cameras. This service is required if
you want to implement one of the PTZ controllers included in the
Monocle project. The Monocle Gateway Service DOES NOT communicate ANY
video or audio content to the Internet. It's sole purpose is to provide
camera control integration for PTZ cameras.This library works in
conjunction with the MonocleCam cloud service to provide camera control
and automation for ONVIF supported network/IP cameras.
